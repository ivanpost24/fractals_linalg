# fractals_linalg

Playing with fractals :)

## Installation

Clone the project with:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:luximus/fractals_linalg.git
```

Then create a new virtual environment by running the following command in the base project folder (fractals_linalg):
```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
```
Then run
```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
```
to activate your virtual environment for the Terminal session.

Finally run
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to install all the necessary packages.

It should be noted that all code was tested only with Python 3.12, although Python 3.11 will likely still work.
